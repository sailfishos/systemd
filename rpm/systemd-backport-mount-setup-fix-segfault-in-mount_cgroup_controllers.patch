Subject: [PATCH] mount-setup: fix segfault in mount_cgroup_controllers when
 using gcc9 compiler

According to the documentation:
https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-9/porting_to.html#complit

The 'join_controllers' that relied on the extended lifetime needs
to be fixed, move the compound literals to the function scope it
need to accessible in.

Resolves: #1868877
